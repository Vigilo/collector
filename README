This is the README for the Collector plugin.

Collector is usually launched by Nagios, returns its results using SpoolMe or
NSCA (for check results) and StoreMe (for performance data).

There are two command-line parameters:
 * -C: the path to the configuration file (/etc/vigilo-collector/general.conf
   by default)
 * -H: the host name or IP address to check

The general.conf file contains additional configuration parameters, such as the
path to the host configuration files. Those files should be generated by
VigiConf, but an example is given in the provided "host.example" file.

See Collector's internal documentation for more help:
    perldoc ./Collector
