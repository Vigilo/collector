This is the README for the Collector plugin.

Collector is usually launched by Nagios, returns its results using SpoolMe
and StoreMe. It takes its parameters from a configuration file, given the
following arguments as command line:
  Collector -l $LIB_DIR -p $BASE_DIR -H $HOST_NAME
By default, $LIB_DIR is /usr/lib/vigilo-collector

It will look for a host configuration file named $BASE_DIR/$HOST_NAME.pm
